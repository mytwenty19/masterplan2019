This is a thought cloud for my 2019 plan.

This is a template to record weekly progress: [week_template](week_template.md).

## Fitness

### Weight

**Start Weight :** 184 lbs

**Goal Weight  :** 164 lbs

**Desired Rate :** 4 lbs/month, 1 lbs/week

Use this table to guide your weight goal at the end of each month. It accounts for beginner gains - losing weight is easier at the start and harder as you get to and below 170 lbs. The last 4 months are for maintenance - finding a way to maintain the weight is key.

| Month | Weight Goal | Actual Weight |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Jan   |    180      |               |
| Feb   |    176      |               |
| Mar   |    172      |               |
| Apr   |    169      |               |
| Jun   |    167      |               |
| Jul   |    165      |               |
| Aug   |    165      |               |
| Sep   |    164      |               |
| Oct   |    164      |               |
| Nov   |    164      |               |
